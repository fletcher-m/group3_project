# Beautiful Soup Tutorial
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook tutorial on how to use the BeautifulSoup library for parsing structured data from webpages.
```
                     (
                  )    )
               _.(--"("""--.._
              /, _..-----).._,\
             |  `'''-----'''`  |
              \               /
               '.           .'
                 '--.....--'

                ___           .-""-.
               /   '''---...-'.'  `\\
               \___...---"""-._-.__//
                               '---'
```

### Audience
Beginer to intermediate Python users interested in learning Beautiful Soup basics.

### Assumptions
1. The website is static. 
2. No additional authentication is required to access the data.
3. The website allows public scraping.
4. There are no other means of extracting data (e.g., through APIs or downloadable data files). <br>

*Note: the tutorial does not cover parsing of a dynamic website or site with enforced authentication requirements*

### Data used in the tutorial
[Wikipedia page on wildfires in California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_California_wildfires) <br>
*Note: wikipedia data was used for demo and learning purposes. It might not be the most efficient way to retrieve data.*
